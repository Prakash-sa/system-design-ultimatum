# Ultimate resource for System Design

A curated collection of system-design diagrams in Excalidraw format. These diagrams collect patterns, example architectures, and interview-style whiteboard sketches. Most files in this repo come from public system-design study sources (annotations preserved in file names) and use a shared Excalidraw component set.
